# Sort_Algo_Comparision
Here I have implemented 

1.Insertion  sort  
2.Merge  sort  
3.In-place  quicksort  (any  random  item  or  the  first  or  the  last  item  of  your  input  can  be  pivot).  
4.Modified  quicksort  
	a.Use  median-of-three  as  pivot.
	b.For  small  subproblem  size (),  you  must  use  insertion  sort.
5. I have also added the file randm. This will ask the user for the input size and create an array of randomly generated numbers of the given size and the same array will be used for sorting in all the 4 sorting algorithms for better comparision of the output times.

Execution  instructions:  
	
	1) These  algorithms are runned for  different  input  sizes  (e.g.    =  500,  1000,  2000,  4000,  5000,  10000,  20000,  30000,  			40000  and  50,000).  
		Numbers are randomly  generated for the input array.  
		Execution time is recorded and average is taken.   
		Graphs are plotted based on the input size and sorting algorithms and are compared with each other for the same data set. 
	
	2) In addition, performance is observed and presented of  the  following  two special cases:  
		a.Input array is already sorted.  
		b.Input array is inversely sorted.  

Language used here is Python.
